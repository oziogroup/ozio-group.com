# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** Simon
**Date:** 2026-01-22

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Ozio Group employer brand & recruitment website positioning
**Goals:** Attract French-speaking rising stars in Israel by positioning as the legitimate alternative to call center jobs

### Project Context

- **Company:** Ozio Group / Ozio LTD (Israel)
- **Product:** European home emergency repair marketplace
- **Scale:** 25,000+ monthly requests, 2,000+ artisan network, 400+ services, 8+ verticals
- **History:** 9 years in operation (since 2016)
- **Constraint:** Must not expose connection to specific French/EU consumer brands

### Target Audience

French-speaking professionals in Israel seeking:
- Real career opportunities (not call center churn)
- Legitimate company with real products
- Stable, growing organization
- Roles in Tech, Sales, Operations, Support

### Key Differentiator

"The Anti-Call-Center" — A real company with real processes, real workflows, building something lasting.

---

## Technique Selection

**Approach:** AI-Recommended Techniques
**Analysis Context:** Employer brand positioning with focus on talent attraction and differentiation

**Recommended Techniques:**

1. **Role Playing:** Understand target candidate perspectives and pain points
2. **Reversal Inversion:** Define anti-patterns (what NOT to be) to clarify authentic positioning
3. **Values Archaeology:** Excavate deep values driving Ozio's culture for authentic messaging

---

## Phase 1: Role Playing

### Persona 1: The Frustrated Call Center Veteran
**Pain Points Identified:**
- Robotic repetition — same script, same product, all day
- Cold calling people who don't want to hear from you
- No meaning, no building, just extracting
- Lonely competition vs. team goals

**What Would Attract Them:**
- Variety (locksmith, plumber, electricity — every call different)
- Inbound demand (50K+ calls/month from people who NEED help)
- Real KPIs, team objectives, professional metrics
- Something to BUILD, not just grind

### Persona 2: The Ambitious Newcomer
**What They're Looking For:**
- Real career path, not just survival
- Transferable skills (SEO, video marketing, B2B sales, AI-first tech)
- Serious budgets (€60K/month SEA) = serious learning
- Greenfield opportunities to build from scratch

**Key Insight:** Ozio isn't competing with call centers — it's competing with "giving up on a real career in Israel"

### Persona 3: The Skeptical Senior
**Proof They Need:**
- €15M+ ARR — real revenue, real scale
- Enterprise B2B clients (major European chains)
- Measurable KPIs, not vanity metrics

**The Filter (Who We DON'T Want):**
- Managers who just give orders
- People who need everything pre-built
- Anyone who doesn't like chaos

**Who We DO Want:**
- Hands-on builders
- Chaos-lovers who thrive in urgency
- People who want everything they build to actually get USED

---

## Phase 2: Reversal Inversion

### Red Flags of Bad Employers (What Call Centers Do)
- "Rapid evolution possible" = You'll never get promoted
- "Limited places!" = Urgency manipulation
- "Coaching on site" = Script reading training
- "Hours: 10-7" = Long hours disguised as normal
- "Percentage + bonuses" = Base salary is garbage
- "Dynamic company" = Chaos without structure
- "Friendly and caring" = Empty words
- **Never mentions industry** = Hiding scammy products
- Green energy, solar, phone subscriptions = Classic traps

### The Ozio Inversions
| They Say | Ozio Says |
|----------|-----------|
| "Rapid evolution" | "9 years. Real growth when earned." |
| "Limited places" | "We hire slow, fire fast." |
| "Coaching on site" | "Real problems. You figure them out." |
| Hides industry | "Home emergencies. Locksmith. Plumber. Real trades." |
| Vague growth claims | "25K requests/month. 2000+ artisans. Verify it." |
| "Friendly team!" | "Direct. Demanding. Fair." |
| "Join us!" | "Build something that lasts." |

### Core Positioning Insight
**"We tell you exactly what we do because we're proud of it."**
Bad employers hide their industry. Ozio leads with it.

## Phase 3: Values Archaeology

### Core Values Uncovered
- **Honesty / No Treason** — Trust is everything
- **Happy or Don't Come** — Engagement is required, not optional
- **Anti-Robot** — If you feel like a robot, something is broken
- **Never Stay Still** — Always moving forward, new products, new challenges
- **Make Your Job Different** — Initiative expected, even in repetitive roles
- **Go Off Script** — Think, adapt, solve — scripts are for robots

### What Makes Ozio Proud
1. **The Mother Locked Out at 2AM** — Real urgency, real help, real meaning
2. **The Technician Who Can Finally Eat** — Enabling artisan entrepreneurs
3. **The Marketplace Magic** — Supply meets demand, the builder's high
4. **Zero Humans on the Line** — Fully automated flows that actually work
5. **The Full Spectrum** — Human when needed, tech when possible, everything in between

### The Ozio Core Truth
**"We build tech that helps REAL people on BOTH sides of the marketplace."**
- Clients in emergencies get help fast
- Technicians who need work get leads
- Technology serving humanity, not replacing it
