# Product Brief: Ozio Group

## Executive Summary

Ozio Group is building a **static recruitment showcase website** to attract French-speaking talent in Israel. The site will serve as a credibility anchor — giving candidates the substance they need to choose Ozio over call centers and understand why a smaller, unknown company can offer what big multinationals cannot.

**Product Type:** Corporate recruitment website (static showcase)
**Primary Goal:** Recruitment funnel for French-speaking professionals
**Target Market:** French speakers in Israel seeking legitimate career alternatives

---

## Core Vision

### Problem Statement

French-speaking professionals in Israel face a constrained job market. Their options typically fall into two categories:
1. **Call centers** — high turnover, scripted work, no career growth, often hiding what they actually sell
2. **Large multinationals** — legitimate but impersonal, candidates are a number in a global machine

The result: talented people either burn out in call center churn or struggle to break into companies where their language skill is truly valued as an asset.

### Problem Impact

- Skilled professionals settle for "survival jobs" instead of careers
- French language becomes a liability (call center trap) instead of an asset
- Talent leaves Israel or gives up on professional growth
- Companies like Ozio struggle to attract candidates who don't know they exist

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

| Competitor Type | Their Pitch | Why It Falls Short |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Call Centers** | "Dynamic team, rapid growth" | Vague, hides industry, high churn |
| **Large Multinationals** | "Join a global leader" | Impersonal, French dept is a cost center |
| **Generic Job Boards** | Listings only | No employer brand, no differentiation |

Ozio is **unknown** — candidates don't search for it. Without a credibility anchor, qualified talent defaults to familiar options.

### Proposed Solution

A **static showcase website** that:
- Establishes Ozio Group as a legitimate European home services marketplace operator
- Provides verifiable proof points (revenue, scale, years in operation)
- Clearly articulates what the company does and why it matters
- Differentiates from call centers through transparency and substance
- Attracts candidates who want ownership, impact, and real career paths

**Not a content platform. Not a blog. A single, well-crafted credibility document.**

### Key Differentiators

| Differentiator | What It Means for Candidates |
|----------------|------------------------------|
| **Real Product** | European home emergency marketplace — not phone subscriptions or solar scams |
| **Verifiable Scale** | €15M+ ARR, 25K monthly requests, 2000+ artisan network, 9 years operating |
| **Ownership Culture** | 30+ people — small enough to matter, big enough to be stable |
| **Anti-Robot Philosophy** | Variety in every role, initiative expected, no scripts |
| **Transparency** | We tell you exactly what we do because we're proud of it |

## Target Users

### Primary Users (Job Candidates)

**Priority 1: The Ambitious Newcomer**
- **Profile:** Early-career professional (1-3 years) looking to build real skills
- **Context:** May have started in a call center but knows they're capable of more
- **Pain:** Struggling to find opportunities where French is an asset, not just a survival tool
- **Goal:** Transferable skills, real projects, legitimate company on their CV
- **Department Fit:** Tech (junior devs, QA), Marketing (content, SEO), Sales (SDR, BDR)
- **What They Need from Site:** Proof this is real, what they'll actually do, growth path clarity

**Priority 2: The Skeptical Senior**
- **Profile:** Experienced professional (5+ years) who's seen it all
- **Context:** Has worked at legitimate companies, won't fall for empty promises
- **Pain:** Burned by vague job posts and companies that oversell
- **Goal:** Real responsibility, measurable impact, fair compensation
- **Department Fit:** Tech (senior/lead), Marketing (manager), Sales (team lead), Operations
- **What They Need from Site:** Numbers, specifics, enterprise credibility, no red flags

**Priority 3: The Frustrated Call Center Veteran**
- **Profile:** Mid-level professional (2-5 years) trapped in the call center cycle
- **Context:** Good at the job but emotionally exhausted from meaningless work
- **Pain:** Robotic repetition, cold calling rejection, no career trajectory
- **Goal:** Variety, meaning, being part of building something
- **Department Fit:** Support (team lead potential), Operations, Sales (warm leads)
- **What They Need from Site:** Clear contrast with call centers, variety in the role, team culture

### Anti-Personas (Who We Filter Out)

| Type | Red Flags | Why They Don't Fit |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| **The Scammer Alumni** | Forex, casinos, sketchy products | Incompatible values, reputation risk |
| **The Delegator** | "I manage, I don't do" | No room for non-builders at 30 people |
| **The Skill-Limited** | Can't grow, won't learn | Chaos environment requires adaptability |

### Secondary Users

| User Type | How They Use the Site | What They Need |
|-----------|----------------------|----------------|
| **HR Partners** | Share with candidates they're sourcing | Quick credibility summary, shareable link |
| **Recruiters** | Due diligence before presenting candidates | Company legitimacy, scale proof, role clarity |
| **LinkedIn Connections** | Research after seeing job post | "Who is Ozio?" answer in one place |

### User Journey

**Discovery:** Candidate sees Ozio job post on LinkedIn → Clicks company link → Lands on ozio-group.com

**First Impression (5 seconds):** "This isn't a call center" — immediate differentiation through messaging and proof points

**Validation (30 seconds):** Scan numbers, understand the product, see legitimate business

**Deep Dive (2-3 minutes):** Read about culture, departments, specific opportunities

**Decision Point:** "I'll apply" or "Not for me" — both outcomes are wins (self-selection)

**Integration:** LinkedIn job listings embedded/linked on site for direct application

## Success Metrics

### Primary Success Indicator

**Application Quality Rate:** Percentage of applications that result in interviews

| Timeframe | Baseline | Target |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Current | 17-25% (2-3 of 12) | — |
| 3 months post-launch | — | 40%+ |
| 6 months post-launch | — | 50%+ |

**Why This Metric:** The site's purpose is credibility and self-selection. If it works, fewer unqualified candidates apply, and more qualified ones feel confident applying.

### Secondary Success Indicators

| Metric | How to Measure | Target |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| **Self-Selection Signal** | Candidates mention site in interview ("I read about your artisan network") | 50%+ of interviewees reference site content |
| **Bounce Rate** | Google Analytics | <60% (indicates they're engaging, not bouncing) |
| **Time on Site** | Google Analytics | >90 seconds average (enough to read key sections) |
| **LinkedIn → Site → Apply Flow** | UTM tracking on LinkedIn job posts | Track full funnel conversion |

### Business Objectives

| Objective | Metric | Target |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **Legitimacy Established** | Candidates stop asking "what do you actually do?" | Reduce HR explanation time |
| **Recruiter Efficiency** | Time saved per candidate screening | Qualitative feedback from HR partners |
| **Brand Consistency** | All job posts link to same credibility source | 100% of posts include site link |

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

**Leading Indicators (early signals):**
- Site visits from LinkedIn (Google Analytics + UTM)
- Pages per session >1.5 (exploring beyond landing)
- Scroll depth >50% on key pages

**Lagging Indicators (outcome proof):**
- Interview-to-application ratio improvement
- Reduction in "not a fit" rejections
- Candidate quality feedback from hiring managers

### What We're NOT Measuring

- **Traffic volume** — Irrelevant; quality over quantity
- **SEO rankings** — Not a discovery play, it's a validation play
- **Social shares** — Not the goal
